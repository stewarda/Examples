Use the Function Get-AWSIngressRules to return all the security groups for a given region and profile to a variable:

`$SecurityGroups = Get-AWSIngressRules -Region us-east-1 -ProfileName 'My-AWS-Profile'
`

You can then sort and return subsets of data based on what you are interested in finding.

Securitygroups where rules are open to 0.0.0.0/0

$SecurityGroups | where {$_.OpenRule -eq 'TRUE'}


Securitygroups where rules are open to 0.0.0.0/0 for high-risk ports (in this example port 22(SSH)
```
$SecurityGroups | where {$_.OpenRule -eq 'TRUE' -and $_.FromPort -eq '22' }
```

Securitygroups that may be unused (no instances, not used by ELBs or RDS)
```
$SecurityGroups | where {$_.NumberInstances -eq '0' -and $_.ELBsInGroup -eq 'NONE' -and $_.RDSGroups -eq 'NONE' }
```
